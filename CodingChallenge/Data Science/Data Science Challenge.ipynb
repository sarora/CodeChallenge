    "### Data Science Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are 2 data challenges that test for your ability to:\n",
    "- Wrangle/clean data to make it usable by a model\n",
    "- Figure out how to set up X's and y's for a use case, given a dataset\n",
    "- Write code to robustly preprocess data\n",
    "- Pick/design the right model, and tune hyperparameters to get the best performance\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any programming language, model, and package to solve these problems. Let us know of any assumptions you make about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables: \n",
    "- Clearly commented code that was written to solve these problems\n",
    "- Your trained models stored in a file (`.pkl`, `.h5`, `.tar` - whatever is appropriate). The models must have `predict(X)` functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How we'll assess your work:\n",
    "- Accuracy/RMSE of your model when predicting on held-out data\n",
    "- How well various edge cases are handled\n",
    "- Efficiency of the code. Is it easy to understand? Are the variable names descriptive? Are there any variables created that aren't used? Is redundant code replaced with function calls? Is vectorized implementation used instead of nested for loops? Are classes defined and objects created where applicable? Are packages used to perform tasks instead of implementing them from scratch?"

    "# Task 1\n",
    "`predictive_maintenance_dataset.csv` is a file that contains parameters and settings (`operational_setting_1`, `operational_setting_2`, `sensor_measurement_1`, `sensor_measurement_2`, etc.) for many wind turbines. There is a column called `unit_number` which specifies which turbine it is, and one called `status`, in which a value of 1 means the turbine broke down that day, and 0 means it didn't. Your task is to create a model that, when fed with operational settings and sensor measurements (`unit_number` and `time_stamp` will *not* be fed in), outputs 1 if the turbine will break down within the next 40 days, and 0 if not."
